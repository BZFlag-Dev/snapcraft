    BZFlag is an Open Source OpenGL multiplayer multiplatform Battle Zone
    capture the Flag game.  At its heart, the game is a 3D first person
    tank simulation where opposing teams battle for dominance.  The game
    was originally written for SGI computers running Irix, but now runs
    and is actively maintained on Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, and other
    platforms. This is an unofficial snap of the game/server. If you have
    snap-specific problems, please contact me and not the project.
